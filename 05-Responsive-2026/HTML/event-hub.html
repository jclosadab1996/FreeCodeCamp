          <h3>Carcassonne Competition</h3>
          <p>
            Carcassonne with its endless expansions remains one of the most
            &nbsp; - if not the most - &nbsp; popular tile-placement games.<br />
            After 4 time-consuming elimination rounds, we could finally crown
            our winner. Our winner had to fight against 49 other players and
            sleep.<br />
            It was an exhausting, but above all fun and successful event.
