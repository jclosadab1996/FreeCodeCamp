fearNotLetter("abce");

// Code Explanation

// First we define variables to store the character code for the first letter in the string, and to store whatever missing letter we may find.

// We turn the string to an array in order to forEach through it instead of using for and while loops.

// As we forEach through our lettersâ€™ character codes, we go comparing with the one that should be in that position.

// If the current letter matches, we move the comparison variable to its next position so we can compare on the next cycle.

// If not, the missing letter will be assigned to the missing variable, which will be returned after the map is finished.

// If there are no missing characters, return undefined.
