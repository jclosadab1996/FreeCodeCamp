function truncateString(str, num) {
  return str.length > num ? str.slice(0, num) + "..." : str;
}

truncateString("A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket", 8);

// Code Explanation
//This solution is very similar to basic solution. To determine the new string, we use a ternary operator. In our ternary operation, if str.length is larger than num, we return a new string which is slice of our string starting at character 0, and ending at num and the '...' is appended to the end of our new string. If str.length is less than or equal to num, we return the string without any truncation.
